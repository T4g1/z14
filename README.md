Display other statistics
>.sstats

Only SCORE_TRACKER_USER should be able to use the feature.

#### Scoring
**Add new scores**
The score is calculated over 10 points, with -10 being the lowest and 10 the highest.
After each joke, the score is input with 
> .score x

where x = score sur [-10;10]

**Correct score**
In case of error, the scores which have been input in the last SCORE_TRACKER_FIX_TIME can be removed.
> .fix x

The functionality must check x against the latest input value & remove only one which matches.

#### Statistics
**Current average**
The current average is calculated by SOMME(score)/COUNT(score)

**Other statistics**
- Trend over the past week / month / year
- Highest / lowest score - All time
- Highest / lowest score - Last month
- Highest / lowest score - Last week

## Dev

To make a succesfull pull request follow this workflow:

* Fork the project
* Describes the feature in an issue on the z14 repository
* When approved, create a branch named `z14-333_title` on your fork (with 333 
being the issue number and title wathever you want related to the issue)
* Do your dev
* Create a pull request closing the issue you created 

### z14.py

* Handle modules loading and self testing.
* Provides basic publish/subscribe design pattern to reduce inter-modules 
dependancy

#### Adding a module

Into your module, you have to add this method outside your module class:
```
def setup(bot):
    bot.add_cog(ScoreTracker(bot))
```

Then in `z14/py`, add your module to the list:
```py
self.modules = [
    'modules.auto_role',
    'modules.feature_request',
    ...
]
```

#### Testing

Your module should define the following method:
```py
def test(self):
    # Do your testing here
    assert not os.getenv("SCORE_TRACKER_USER") is None, \
        "SCORE_TRACKER_USER is not defined"

    try:
        time = int(os.getenv("SCORE_TRACKER_FIX_TIME"))
    except Exception as e:
        self.fail("SCORE_TRACKER_FIX_TIME is not a proper integer")
```

#### Publish/Subscribe design pattern

**Publishing to a topic**

In your custom module:
```py
await self.bot.publish(ctx, "score_tracker.scored", score)
```

You should give the current commands.Context, the topic name and some 
value (optionnal)

**Listening to a topic**

In your custom module on_ready:
```py
@commands.Cog.listener()
async def on_ready(self):
    await self.bot.subscribe("score_tracker.scored", self)
```

You should give the topic name and who is listening (self)

Then you need to define the callback as follows:
```py
async def on_topic_published(self, ctx, topic, value):
    # Change to put your code here
    pass
```

### Modules

* Every module you add should go in that folder
